Note that this was a one-time change, so if you’d like to change your name in the future, you will have to purchase a Summoner name change in the store under the ‘Account’ tab.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else! Best of luck to you on the Rift!\n\nThe 0rphan\nRiot Games Player Support\nMorgana Support",
