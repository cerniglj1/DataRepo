    "comment" : "Dear Customer Support,\r\n\r\nI hope your day is going well Rioter! I'm just having trouble obtaining the unchained Alistar skin.\r\nAttempting to use the link to redeem the unchained Alistar only brings up a blank page and\r\nI am subscribed to the League's youtube channel\r\nBut am unable to discover how to get skin through normal means.\r\nPlease see the attached screenshot where I am signed in and subscribed to RiotGamesInc YouTube channel. And the second page where the http://youtube.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/youtube brings up a blank page.\r\nIf unchained Alistar is no longer available I understand, and this ticket can be disregarded after I am notified of such. Otherwise can someone please direct me on how to resolve this issue?\r\nThank you,\r\nZestyHummus",
