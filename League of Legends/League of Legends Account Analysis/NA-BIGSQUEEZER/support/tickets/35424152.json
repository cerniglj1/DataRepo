    "comment" : "Hey Riot Support!\r\n\r\nOn Saturday June 16th I played in a League of Legends Tournament at the Microsoft Store in Roosevelt Field Mall (ROG). My team and I won first place but I never received my reward (I think it was RP). I was informed it would be added to my account within 2 weeks but it's been longer than that. My smash.gg email used was: imzessed@gmail.com. I watched the TO put in the email properly and my username is the same on there as it is ingame. If there are any further details needed I'd be happy to supply them.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and GL on the rift,\r\nJames",
